_Customize GitHub Copilot to your personal or company needs in less than an hour._

## Welcome

People love how GitHub Copilot helps them write code faster and with fewer errors.
But what if it already knew some context about your job, team, or company?
In this exercise, we will make a custom extension for GitHub Copilot that can help you with that.

- **Who is this for**: Intermediate developers familiar with GitHub Copilot, basic GitHub, and basic web development
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce GitHub Copilot Extensions and how to customize them.
- **What you'll build**: You'll load an existing template extension and then modify it to support the staff of a high school.
- **Prerequisites**: Skills Exercise: Getting Started with GitHub Copilot
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this exercise, you will:

1. Start up a preconfigured development environment for making a GitHub Copilot Extension.
2. Run the included template extension.
3. Connect the extension to your GitHub account.
4. Customize the extension to your needs.
5. Practice prompting with your new custom Github Copilot Extension.

   </a>

2. In the new tab, most of the fields will automatically fill in for you.

   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use [Actions minutes](https://docs.github.chttps://github.com/zorfling/skills-your-first-extension-for-github-copilot/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.

3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds for the course to be prepared.

   - The **Copy Exercise** button will deactivate, changing to gray.
   - The **Start Exercise** button will activate, changing to green.

4. Click **Start Exercise**. Follow the step-by-step instructions and feedback will be provided as you progress.
